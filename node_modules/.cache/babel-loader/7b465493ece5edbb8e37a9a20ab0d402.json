There are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt\n        to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th\n        century. Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters\n        on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought\n        of making the results durable. Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the\n        first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing\n        camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed\n        photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to\n        fix these images.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"history\">\n        In the mid-1820s, Nicéphore Niépce first managed to fix an image that\n        was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several\n        days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results\n        were very crude. Niépce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop\n        the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially\n        viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of\n        exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The\n        details were introduced to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted\n        as the birth year of practical photography. The metal-based\n        daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based\n        calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox\n        Talbot and demonstrated in 1839 soon after news about the daguerreotype\n        reached Talbot.{\" \"}\n      </p> */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nexport default HistoryComponent;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
