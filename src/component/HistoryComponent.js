        The history of photography began in remote antiquity with the discovery
        of two critical principles: camera obscura image projection and the
        observation that some substances are visibly altered by exposure to
        light. There are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate any attempt
        to capture images with light sensitive materials prior to the 18th
        century. Around 1717, Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters
        on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought
        of making the results durable. Around 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the
        first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing
        camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed
        photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to
        fix these images.

        In the mid-1820s, Nicéphore Niépce first managed to fix an image that
        was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several
        days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results
        were very crude. Niépce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop
        the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially
        viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of
        exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The
        details were introduced to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted
        as the birth year of practical photography. The metal-based
        daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based
        calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox
        Talbot and demonstrated in 1839 soon after news about the daguerreotype
        reached Talbot.
